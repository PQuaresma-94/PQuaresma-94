## 👋 Hello there!

I'm **Pedro Quaresma**, a **Software Engineer** with a strong background in **Quality Assurance**, leveraging analytical skills and leadership abilities to build robust and innovative solutions.

After several years as a **Quality Assurance Specialist** at **Talkdesk**, I transitioned into software engineering to engage more deeply in developing features and solving complex problems. My QA expertise ensures a strong emphasis on code quality, reliability, and user satisfaction in my development work.

At Talkdesk, I collaborated closely with the Strategic Integration team to enhance CRM platform integrations with **Salesforce**, **Microsoft Dynamics 365**, and **ServiceNow**. By leading meetings and retrospectives, I improved team productivity and streamlined processes, resulting in a **30% improvement in integration quality** and a **40% reduction in bug resolution time**.

I recently completed a comprehensive **Software Engineering bootcamp**, where I honed my skills in **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**. My projects include developing full-stack web applications with a focus on performance optimization and user experience.

Previously, as a **sports coach** with a Master’s degree in Science, with minor in Sports Coaching, I developed leadership, teamwork, and analytical skills by creating tailored training programs and mentoring athletes to achieve their goals. This experience has been invaluable in fostering effective collaboration and project management in tech environments.

I’m eager to leverage my diverse background to contribute to innovative tech solutions that enhance performance and drive success. By integrating my expertise in QA and software engineering with the leadership skills from coaching, I aim to deliver high-quality software that exceeds user expectations.
