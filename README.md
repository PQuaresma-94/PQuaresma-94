## 👋 Hello there!

After gaining experience as a QA Specialist, I discovered a passion for software engineering, driven by the thrill of developing features and solving complex problems. This led me to pursue a software engineering bootcamp, where I now focus on leveraging my QA background to build innovative solutions.

At Talkdesk, I worked with the Strategic Integration team to ensure the quality of CRM platform integrations, leading meetings and retrospectives to enhance productivity. I have honed my strengths in analytical thinking, communication, teamwork, and leadership throughout my career as a competitive athlete, coach, analyst, and now engineer. These strengths have been the keys to my success.

Originally a sports coach with a Master's in Sports Coaching, I realized that I could make a greater impact by creating technology that helps athletes achieve their goals. This realization inspired my transition into tech through a QA bootcamp, blending my coaching experience with my technical skills.

Today, I am dedicated to using my diverse background in coaching and tech to create solutions that drive performance and success in both fields.
