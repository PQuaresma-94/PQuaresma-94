## About Me

After gaining experience as a QA Specialist, I discovered a passion for software engineering, driven by the thrill of developing features and solving complex problems. This led me to pursue a software engineering bootcamp, where I now focus on leveraging my QA background to build innovative solutions.

At Talkdesk, I worked with the Strategic Integration team to ensure the quality of CRM platform integrations, leading meetings and retrospectives to enhance productivity. My strengths in analytical thinking, communication, teamwork, and leadership have been key to my success.

Originally a sports coach with a Master's in Sports Coaching, I realized that I could make a greater impact by creating technology that helps athletes achieve their goals. This realization inspired my transition into tech through a QA bootcamp, blending my coaching experience with my technical skills.

Today, I am dedicated to using my diverse background in coaching and tech to create solutions that drive performance and success in both fields

After my experience as a QA Specialist, I discovered a new passion for software engineering. The thrill of developing new features, solving complex problems, and being creative in my work led me to start a software engineering bootcamp. I am now focused on pursuing a career where I can leverage my QA background and technical expertise to build innovative solutions.

As a QA Specialist at Talkdesk, I worked with the Strategic Integration team to ensure the quality of Talkdesk's contact center software integration with various CRM platforms. In this role, I led meetings, refinements, and retrospectives to ensure productivity and efficiency. My strengths in attention to detail, analytical thinking, communication skills, technical expertise, teamwork, adaptability, time management, leadership, customer focus, and self-motivation have all contributed to my success in the role.

My journey into the tech industry began with a deep passion for sports coaching. As a Master's graduate in Sports Coaching, former sports coach, and member of the Swimming Regional Arbitration Council team in Lisbon, I learned how to lead, motivate, and work with athletes to achieve their highest potential. However, I soon realized that I could make an even greater impact by creating technology that helps athletes attain their goals and become top performers. This realization led me to transition into the tech field through a QA bootcamp, where I could combine my love for technology with my desire to support athletes.

Overall, my background in sports coaching, combined with my experience in tech, makes me a well-rounded and valuable candidate for roles in software engineering, QA, and related fields. I am where I want to be, using my unique combination of skills to create solutions that help people achieve their best.
