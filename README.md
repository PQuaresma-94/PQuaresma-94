## About Me

After my experience as a QA Specialist, I discovered a new passion for software engineering. The thrill of developing new features, solving complex problems, and being creative in my work led me to start a software engineering bootcamp. I am now focused on pursuing a career where I can leverage my QA background and technical expertise to build innovative solutions.

As a QA Specialist at Talkdesk, I worked with the Strategic Integration team to ensure the quality of Talkdesk's contact center software integration with various CRM platforms. In this role, I led meetings, refinements, and retrospectives to ensure productivity and efficiency. My strengths in attention to detail, analytical thinking, communication skills, technical expertise, teamwork, adaptability, time management, leadership, customer focus, and self-motivation have all contributed to my success in the role.

With a Master's degree in Sports Coaching, and my experience as a sports coach and a member of the Swimming Regional Arbitration Council team in Lisbon, I bring a unique set of skills to the tech industry. My background in sports coaching taught me how to lead, motivate, and work with individuals toward their goals. When I realized that sports coaching wasn't fully aligned with my long-term career aspirations, I made a deliberate decision to transition into the tech field by completing a QA bootcamp. This shift allowed me to combine my leadership abilities with a growing passion for technology.

Overall, my diverse background, coupled with my continuous drive for learning and development, makes me a well-rounded and valuable candidate for roles in software engineering, QA, and related fields.
